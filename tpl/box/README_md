## Configuration

The following configuration options are possible:

An example configuration can be found in `/opt/smx/conf/<box_name>-<maj_version>.json`.

## Triggers

## Events

## Signature

The box has the following input ports:

The box has the following output ports:

## Using the library

When a box `<box_name>` is spawned as a net in a Streamix network, the box must
be marked as `extern` in the Streamix code and the application must be compiled
with `-l<lib_name>` (add this to the `EXT_LIBS` variable in the app Makefile).

## Compiling and Installing

A Makefile is provided that allows to
 - compile the box implementation to a library `lib<lib_name>` (`make`)
 - create `deb` packages including the library, this document, and the default configuration file (`make dpkg`)
 - manually install to the target folders (`sudo make install`)

## Testing

The folder `test` contains a testing environment.
In order set up test the following steps must be taken:
 1. Add test data to the node `test_data` in the configuration file `test.json`.
 2. Describe the data conversion from JSON data to Streamix messages in the function `<box_name>_in_data_conversion()` of the file `test_<box_name>.c`.
 3. Describe the data conversion from a Streamix messages to JSON data and evaluate the result in the function `<box_name>_out_data_conversion()` of the file `test_<box_name>.c`.
 4. Compile the program with the command `make`.
 5. Run the test with either of the following commands
   - `./<box_name>`
   - `make run`.
