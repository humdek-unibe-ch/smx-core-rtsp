# Streamix Message Definition `smx_msg_<msg_name>`

This library provides message definitions for messages that are ...

## Using the library

When a `<msg_name>` message is used in a Streamix box implementation, the file
`smx_msg_<msg_name>.h` must be added to the box implemntation header and the
box implemntation must be compiled with `-lsmxmsg<msg_name>` (add this to the
`EXT_LIBS` variable in the box Makefile).

## Compiling and Installing

A Makefile is provided that allows to
 - compile the msg definition to a library `libsmxmsg<msg_name>` (`make`)
 - create `deb` packages including the library and this document (`make dpkg`)
 - manually install to the target folders (`sudo make install`)

## Dependencies
