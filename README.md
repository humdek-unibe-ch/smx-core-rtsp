# Streamix Preprocessor `smxrtsp`
Reads the dependency graph of a Streamix program (generated by the Streamix compiler [smxc](https://github.com/moiri/streamix-c)) and generates C code that can be used by the Streamix runtime system [smxrts](https://github.com/humdek-unibe-ch/smx-core-rts).

## Building

    make
    sudo make install

## Dependencies
 - [`igraph`](http://igraph.org/c/) - make sure GraphML is enabled
 - [`smx-utils-libgen`](https://github.com/humdek-unibe-ch/smx-utils-libgen)

Note that [`smx-core-sua_lang`](https://github.com/humdek-unibe-ch/smx-core-sia_lang) is added as a git submodule which uses [`uthash`](https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash).
